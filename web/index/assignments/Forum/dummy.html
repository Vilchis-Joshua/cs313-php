            What is CBA? CBA is Cyberbullying Awareness. In current society, there have been more and more problems with bullying <br />
            on the internet. What are the problems? What are the symptoms of a victim? What can we do? This forum is a place for those involved<br />
            and for those who wish to help someone that they know if they are suffering, as well as a place to pose new questions and concerns. <br />
            Nobody here is an actual doctor, so no one should "prescribe" a prescription, but it should be a place of discussion to help get the word out <br />
            so that we can better work towards a solution.
